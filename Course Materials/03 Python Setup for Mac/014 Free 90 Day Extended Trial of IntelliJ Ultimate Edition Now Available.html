<p>Great news!</p>

<p>We have negotiated an extended 90 day license for you to use the IntelliJ Ultimate edition software from Jetbrains, the makers of IntelliJ. This is an extra 90 days of free access to this incredible tool.</p>

<p>Details on how to download and install this software are in this section of this course.</p>

<p>All you need to do to get your extended 90 day license is to email <strong>courses@learnprogramming.academy</strong> (note the email address carefully).</p>

<p>A Learn Programming Academy (LPA) team member will then reply with your unique coupon code, and a document explaining how you go about registering with Jetbrains on their website.</p>

<p>Don’t worry, we won’t ever spam you, or even store your email.  This is a once off email to get the code to you, along with a PDF that contains the instructions you need.  We won’t email you again after sending you the code!</p>

<p><strong>Please note that LPA team members at that email address are not programmers, so are unable to to provide “support”.  Please use the Q&amp;A section of this course for any questions you may have.</strong></p>

<p>Also note that you can still use the community edition of IntelliJ if you prefer, but I recommend you start off with IntelliJ Ultimate first.</p>

<p>Note:  The LPA team works office hours (Australian time).  Depending on the time of day or night in your part of the world, it might take 24-48 hours to get the coupon to you.  In rare cases 72 hours. We do not make any commission out of giving you this code.  We do it purely to give you an extended trial of IntelliJ for free.  IntelliJ rocks our world.</p>

<p>NOTE:  You already have a 30 day free trial when you download IntelliJ Ultimate.  So there is no urgency to add the 90 day trial code. It will continue to work for 30 days, even without the code we will be sending you.  In fact if you wait until your 30 day trial is ready to expire, you can apply the 90 day code at that time, to give you in total a 120 day trial!</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can go ahead and use the free community edition, or download the trial version of the Ultimate edition and get that 30 day trial while you wait for us to reply with the code.  More info is in the IntelliJ video in this section of the course.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>regards</p>

<p>The LPA Team</p></p>
